 * the pricing table on /sellLandingPage, and the listing-limit upgrade

 * fields, upload endpoints (`/listings/:id/service-history`,

 * mainstream buyers who don't shop by cc. Backend column + Prisma field +
 * sub-model master-data spec stay intact — only the UI hides, and existing
 * cc values keep being stored (just not shown).
